# Core Studio Interaction: Section E

This course exposes students to thorough and elaborate interactive concepts and techniques for applications. It is an extensive investigation in the interface, the mechanism, the controls and the aims of interactive works. Students will learn how to design and develop complex interactive projects and understand how to undertake a comprehensive research and direct their thinking process from brainstorming to final outcome. They will be given the tools to conceive, plan and develop an interactive system and they will become aware of the importance of their role in the development of interactive media.

## Projects {projects}

### Assignment 1: The Post {thepost}

As graphic designers, it is important to understand the internet and its platforms as a medium. What do certain platforms allow for that others do not? How might a platform transform a user's perception of content? Does the design of some platforms feel invisible? What are the implications of posting content on one platform as opposed to another? 

For our first project, find a piece of content that has surpassed its copyright ([archive.org](http://archive.org), [ubu.web](http://ubuweb.com) are good places to start your search). Think about the content's form and message. What qualities stick out to you (is it divided into stanzas? is it repetitive? does it have a linear narrative? was it meant to be rearranged? can it be rearranged? does it have [no letter e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Void)?)? 
Publish your selected text on a platform of your choice. Think about how this act of publishing emphasizes a quality of your content (it does not have to be all at once). How has the content changed through your platform? What is something new that this publishing act has revealed about your content? 

How will the reading of the text be affected by the choice of platform? Does the TUMBLR community create a different context for writing and images than the Second Life community for example? Think also about the technical constraints of different platforms. How are texts broken up? In 140 character blurbs? In longer sequences? How does each piece of text link to the next one. Are there different voices you can use? Can the text be broken up into sequential sections? What about parallel sections? How does the text look on the page? How do all these elements affect your reading of the text? How many of these elements can you control? What is the typical way we read text on the service you are using? Are you interrupting this ‘usual’ read, using it to your advantage?

Document your project through screenshots and think carefully about its presentation. 

### Assignment 2: The Hyperlink, Pt. 1 {hyperlink}

The hyperlink (or link) is arguably the cornerstone of the internet. A hyperlink can transport a user from page to page, or website to website— it acts as the linking mechanism through which the whole internet is at our disposal. Through hyperlinks, a user is able to construct their own path or narrative.

You will design and develop a multi-page website around the hyperlink that intertwines your selected content and produces a new narrative:

Select two pieces of content that complement each other in some way. Think about how these pieces may fragment and weave through each other (how do they relate? Are there points where the content breaks easily? What new meaning can you construct by pairing disparate sentences together? How does seeing fragments of content on each page shift the pacing of your new narrative? Are all the links treated the same? different? What kind of hierarchy can you introduce into your narrative?). 

Begin to think about how the site structure begins to influence the user's understanding of your texts. How might the navigation alter the contents meaning? 

For next class, prepare a short presentation on your selected pieces of content, what you find interesting about their pairing, and how you plan on collaging them, and what new narrative this collaging produces.

### Assignment 2: The Hyperlink, Pt. 2 {hyperlink2}

For next week, make a diagram that maps out your site&rsquo;s structure (i.e. the site&rsquo;s content architecture).

Allow this diagram to be as detailed as possible: what text is on what web page? What pages link to others? Does the narrative loop? how does it intertwine? Are there dead ends? can you go back? Does your site have multiple starting points?

Think about how the structure of your site might influence the user&rsquo;s understanding of your narrative. Is there a traditional beginning, middle, and end? Are they clear to the user? (Should they be clear to the user?)

### Assignment 2: The Hyperlink, Pt. 3 {hyperlink3}

Based on feedback from class, finalize your site&rsquo;s structure. In addition, begin drafting designs (i.e. the user interface) of your site. _For next class, bring in your finalized diagram, and at least two visual directions for your site_. 

Think about how the designs for your interface reflect both the site&rsquo;s content as well as its structure. 
- What visual cues do you provide to your user? 
- How do you signify different types of links?
- How does typography influence the user&rsquo;s understanding of the content?
- Are page designs prescribed? Do they follow a grid? Why/why not?
- What reoccuring visual signals are there? What do they suggest to the user?

### Assignment 2: The Hyperlink, Pt. 4 {hyperlink4}

Based on feedback from class, select one design direction and refine it. This means determining and keeping a visual language, levels of hierarchy, and button and link types. As you continue your designs, begin to think about how you may build your pages. 

If need be, continue finalizing your site&rsquo;s structure. 

For next week, the site structure should be finalized and your site&rsquo;s design should be implemented across at least 80% of your pages.

### Assignment 2: The Hyperlink, Pt. 5 {hyperlink5}

Based on feedback from class, finalize your design to a point where you can begin building it.

For next class, prepare a pdf of your site map and site designs, an begin to build at least _two_ pages of your site in html + css.

In finalizing your design, consider the levels of hierarchy in your site (this will help clarify the type of CSS you&rsquo;ll need to use). 
- Are there titles? subtitles? sub-subtitles? are they consistently treated? Should they be consistently treated? 
- Are there different types of hyperlinks? How might the user identify them or differentiate them from non-linkable text?
- which elements stay consistent on your site? which elements change? 

As you begin building your site&rsquo;s pages, take apart your designs piece by piece. Think about what elements are easiest to place and style— do those first. Finish placing one element before moving on to the next, and remember: additional elements can often influence others. 

If you run into bugs, try and isolate which specific CSS attribute is causing the problem. Use Google to search for problems ("CSS width 100% not working", "CSS padding-left not showing up") by using keywords. 

### Assignment 2: The Hyperlink, Pt. 6 {hyperlink6}

Continue working on your project. For next class, continue building your website in HTML and CSS. By next class, you should have the majority of your project built.

Over the next week, it may be necessary to simplify your design. In doing so, be sure to consider the following questions: 
- What is the key interaction that drives your user? How might simplifying your design emphasize this interaction?
- Is there variance in your page designs? How might you introduce consistency in how you build the pages while still retaining that variance?
- Are there pages that aren&rsquo;t necessary? 

Be sure to make note of any bugs you run into. Try and isolate these issues as much as possible (even down to the specific CSS attribute or html element).

### Assignment 3: Innovation and Invention, Pt. 1 {iandi}

This assignment is based on Bruno Latour’s vignette, [The Berlin Key](/readings/P-36-Berliner-KEY-GB.pdf). For this project, you will select and research a specific technological object. Design and build a website that interprets this object's behavioral influence. 

For next class (March 1), read _The Berlin Key_ and take notes on the influential role of the key on the surrounding individual's behaviors. What technologies do you know of that have influenced behaviors at a similar scale? Find an object and prepare a brief presentation on it&rsquo;s history and influence on people&rsquo;s behaviors. 

Consider the following questions:
- How has this object influenced the behavioral pattern of individuals using it?
- How has this object influenced the behavioral pattern of communities using it?
- Does this object bring people closer together, or push them further apart?
- Who designed this object and why? 
- How prevalent is this object now? If it is a historical object, what made people stop using it?
- What did this object supersede? What superseded this object?

### Assignment 3: Innovation and Invention, Pt. 2 {iandi2}

Based on feedback from class, take a moment to reevaluate your object. How might you best distill the interaction your object hinges upon? Consider both how its form and location influence this interaction, as well as what technologies and inventions influence this designed behavior. If the object requires/maintains multiple types of interactions, how do these produced behaviors work with one another? 

For next class, isolate the object-produced behavior (i.e. interaction) you are most interested in and begin to conceptualize how your object may be translated into a stand-alone website. 

Bring in at least _two_ directions for your site. Focus on clearly illustrating the primariy interaction of your object and how it translates onto the web as well as bringing in several wireframes outlining the structure of your site.

### Assignment 3: Innovation and Invention, Pt. 3 {iandi3}
Based on feedback from class, choose one direction for your site. Continue to develop this site interaction, and begin to detail this interaction (either through hyperlinked pdfs, a coded prototype, or some sort of prototyping tool like Invision, Principle, or Adobe XD). 

Consider how you might best communicate this interaction to your audience for useful feedback.


### Assignment 3: Innovation and Invention, Pt. 4 {iandi4}
Today&rsquo;s class focused on gathering general feedback on your proposed interaction:
- What aspects of your design were confusing? 
- Which parts of your site&rsquo;s interaction did users gravitate towards? 
- Did feedback suggest that your design had its intended effect? If not, what was the effect? How might you change it?

Using the feedback you received, identify problematic points in your design. Review your notes and refine your website&rsquo;s interaction. Begin laying out the visual design of your site. 

For next class, you should have an updated prototype (PDF, Adobe XD, Invision, After Effects, or Principle) ready for further user testing. This prototype should be self directing (meaning you don&rsquo;t have to be present for a user to navigate it).

Based off of the responses towards your initial prototype, you should also compose a list of (at least) five questions that can be answered on a spectrum (an example of a spectrum question can be found [here](https://cdn.smassets.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MD-1348_MultipleChoice_graphic3a.png)) and offer a follow-up explanation (i.e. "why?"). Have 14 copies printed out for next class. 


### Assignment 3: Innovation and Invention, Pt. 5 {iandi5}

Review the user feedback you received in class and allow it to inform your final design revisions. 

For next class (March 15), your design should be resolved (i.e. all but final) and you should have begun programming your site. Focus on laying out your html/css and setting up your classes and id&rsquo;s in a way that allows you to easily access the your interactive elements with your javascript. 

For next class you should have also read [Autoprogettazione?](/readings/enzo-mari.pdf) by Enzo Mari and posted a question in response on the Slack.

### Assignment 3: Innovation and Invention, Pt. 6 {iandi6}
Use today&rsquo;s feedback to finalize your design. You should be well underway in coding your site. For next class (March 26), have your entire site roughly coded so that we can refine your live website upon our return from break. Please pay close attention to how your interaction manifests in an html setting, and how you may modify your design to benefit the natural tendencies of your code.

### Assignment 4: Observations, Pt. 1 {observations}
_Assignment Prompt_:

[Jean Baudrillard](/readings/Baudrillard-TheSystemofCollecting.pdf) outlines collections as the collective separation of objects of their utility. An object within a true collection becomes purely aesthetic. A true collection acts as a mirror to its owner— it is given and retains meaning through the owner's presence and care. Create or find a collection of at least 40 objects. Your assignment is divided into two stages— organization and interpretation:

Begin to organize this collection through the design and development of a simple website. 
- What does organizing this collection begin to reveal? What patterns are present? What discrepancies? 
- What themes does this collection hold? 
- How does the site's design reflect the structures of the collection?

_For April 5_:

For next class, bring in at least one collection of 40 items or more. In your selection, consider how each object relates to other objects in your growing collection and how it might differentiate itself.

### Assignment 4: Observations, Pt. 2 {observations2}

The first part of our final project consists of organizing your collection through the design and development of a JSON-fed website.

In creating this website, you should consider the following questions:
- Does your collection have a thesis?
- What opinion (or opinions) can you present through your collection?
- What does organizing this collection begin to reveal? 
- What patterns are present? What discrepancies? 
- What themes does this collection hold? 
- How does the site&rsquo;s design reflect the structures of the collection? 
- What are your organizing principles? Are they identitical with how the site&rsquo;s content is navigable? 


_For April 11_:

Use the classifications that you and your classmates have generated in class to organize your collection. 

### Assignment 4: Observations, Pt. 3 {observations3}

For next class (April 16):
- continue refining your collection&rsquo;s scope
- continue refining the design of your collection&rsquo;s site. _Your site&rsquo;s design should act as a visual prototype so that you can begin translating it into html next week._ 
- construct a JSON object of your collection and have it export its contents onto an html page.

### Assignment 4: Observations, Pt. 4 {observations4}

For next class (April 23):
- Finish developing your collection&rsquo;s site (April 23 will be our final check-in for this part of the assignment before the final crit (May 14)), and upload your site to github pages.

- Begin sketches for the second half of this assignment. For next class, bring in initial sketches for _two_ different directions. As a reminder, the brief is below: 

Based on the findings from the first part of this assignment, design and develop a second website that is mobile-first. 
What about your collection excites you the most? What opinion is your collection presenting? How might this aspect of your collection be presented best in a website? This website may or may not contain artifacts of your collection, but should clearly communicate an interpretation of your collection through its design and interaction.

### Assignment 4: Observations, Pt. 5 {observations5}

For next class (April 26):
- Based on today&rsquo;s working session, bring in digital sketches proposing your site (these should illustrate both mobile and scaled formats). Be sure to clearly identify the core aspect of your site— how does it interpret your original collection?

A few questions to consider are:
- How does your website interpret your original collection? Through visual layout? Interaction? A combination of both? 
- How does your website scale? Is there a change in interaction?
- How does this website pair with your collection website (the first half of this assignment)? Are they linked? Fully integrated? entirely separate?
