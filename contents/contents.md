# Core Studio Interaction: Section E

This course exposes students to thorough and elaborate interactive concepts and techniques for applications. It is an extensive investigation in the interface, the mechanism, the controls and the aims of interactive works. Students will learn how to design and develop complex interactive projects and understand how to undertake a comprehensive research and direct their thinking process from brainstorming to final outcome. They will be given the tools to conceive, plan and develop an interactive system and they will become aware of the importance of their role in the development of interactive media.

## Projects {projects}

### Assignment 1: The Post {thepost}

As graphic designers, it is important to understand the internet and its platforms as a medium. What do certain platforms allow for that others do not? How might a platform transform a user's perception of content? Does the design of some platforms feel invisible? What are the implications of posting content on one platform as opposed to another? 

For our first project, find a piece of content that has surpassed its copyright ([archive.org](http://archive.org), [ubu.web](http://ubuweb.com) are good places to start your search). Think about the content's form and message. What qualities stick out to you (is it divided into stanzas? is it repetitive? does it have a linear narrative? was it meant to be rearranged? can it be rearranged? does it have [no letter e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Void)?)? 
Publish your selected text on a platform of your choice. Think about how this act of publishing emphasizes a quality of your content (it does not have to be all at once). How has the content changed through your platform? What is something new that this publishing act has revealed about your content? 

How will the reading of the text be affected by the choice of platform? Does the TUMBLR community create a different context for writing and images than the Second Life community for example? Think also about the technical constraints of different platforms. How are texts broken up? In 140 character blurbs? In longer sequences? How does each piece of text link to the next one. Are there different voices you can use? Can the text be broken up into sequential sections? What about parallel sections? How does the text look on the page? How do all these elements affect your reading of the text? How many of these elements can you control? What is the typical way we read text on the service you are using? Are you interrupting this ‘usual’ read, using it to your advantage?

Document your project through screenshots and think carefully about its presentation. 

### Assignment 2: The Hyperlink, Pt. 1 {hyperlink}

The hyperlink (or link) is arguably the cornerstone of the internet. A hyperlink can transport a user from page to page, or website to website— it acts as the linking mechanism through which the whole internet is at our disposal. Through hyperlinks, a user is able to construct their own path or narrative.

You will design and develop a multi-page website around the hyperlink that intertwines your selected content and produces a new narrative:

Select two pieces of content that complement each other in some way. Think about how these pieces may fragment and weave through each other (how do they relate? Are there points where the content breaks easily? What new meaning can you construct by pairing disparate sentences together? How does seeing fragments of content on each page shift the pacing of your new narrative? Are all the links treated the same? different? What kind of hierarchy can you introduce into your narrative?). 

Begin to think about how the site structure begins to influence the user's understanding of your texts. How might the navigation alter the contents meaning? 

For next class, prepare a short presentation on your selected pieces of content, what you find interesting about their pairing, and how you plan on collaging them, and what new narrative this collaging produces.

### Assignment 2: The Hyperlink, Pt. 2 {hyperlink2}

For next week, make a diagram that maps out your site&rsquo;s structure (i.e. the site&rsquo;s content architecture).

Allow this diagram to be as detailed as possible: what text is on what web page? What pages link to others? Does the narrative loop? how does it intertwine? Are there dead ends? can you go back? Does your site have multiple starting points?

Think about how the structure of your site might influence the user&rsquo;s understanding of your narrative. Is there a traditional beginning, middle, and end? Are they clear to the user? (Should they be clear to the user?)

### Assignment 2: The Hyperlink, Pt. 3 {hyperlink3}

Based on feedback from class, finalize your site&rsquo;s structure. In addition, begin drafting designs (i.e. the user interface) of your site. _For next class, bring in your finalized diagram, and at least two visual directions for your site_. 

Think about how the designs for your interface reflect both the site&rsquo;s content as well as its structure. 
- What visual cues do you provide to your user? 
- How do you signify different types of links?
- How does typography influence the user&rsquo;s understanding of the content?
- Are page designs prescribed? Do they follow a grid? Why/why not?
- What reoccuring visual signals are there? What do they suggest to the user?

### Assignment 2: The Hyperlink, Pt. 4 {hyperlink4}

Based on feedback from class, select one design direction and refine it. This means determining and keeping a visual language, levels of hierarchy, and button and link types. As you continue your designs, begin to think about how you may build your pages. 

If need be, continue finalizing your site&rsquo;s structure. 

For next week, the site structure should be finalized and your site&rsquo;s design should be implemented across at least 80% of your pages.

### Assignment 2: The Hyperlink, Pt. 5 {hyperlink5}

Based on feedback from class, finalize your design to a point where you can begin building it.

For next class, prepare a pdf of your site map and site designs, an begin to build at least _two_ pages of your site in html + css.

In finalizing your design, consider the levels of hierarchy in your site (this will help clarify the type of CSS you&rsquo;ll need to use). 
- Are there titles? subtitles? sub-subtitles? are they consistently treated? Should they be consistently treated? 
- Are there different types of hyperlinks? How might the user identify them or differentiate them from non-linkable text?
- which elements stay consistent on your site? which elements change? 

As you begin building your site&rsquo;s pages, take apart your designs piece by piece. Think about what elements are easiest to place and style— do those first. Finish placing one element before moving on to the next, and remember: additional elements can often influence others. 

If you run into bugs, try and isolate which specific CSS attribute is causing the problem. Use Google to search for problems ("CSS width 100% not working", "CSS padding-left not showing up") by using keywords. 

### Assignment 2: The Hyperlink, Pt. 6 {hyperlink6}

Continue working on your project. For next class, continue building your website in HTML and CSS. By next class, you should have the majority of your project built.

Over the next week, it may be necessary to simplify your design. In doing so, be sure to consider the following questions: 
- What is the key interaction that drives your user? How might simplifying your design emphasize this interaction?
- Is there variance in your page designs? How might you introduce consistency in how you build the pages while still retaining that variance?
- Are there pages that aren&rsquo;t necessary? 

Be sure to make note of any bugs you run into. Try and isolate these issues as much as possible (even down to the specific CSS attribute or html element).

### Assignment 3: Innovation and Invention, Pt. 1 {iandi}

This assignment is based on Bruno Latour’s vignette, [The Berlin Key](/readings/P-36-Berliner-KEY-GB.pdf). For this project, you will select and research a specific technological object. Design and build a website that interprets this object's behavioral influence. 

For next class (March 1), read _The Berlin Key_ and take notes on the influential role of the key on the surrounding individual's behaviors. What technologies do you know of that have influenced behaviors at a similar scale? Find an object and prepare a brief presentation on it&rsquo;s history and influence on people&rsquo;s behaviors. 

Consider the following questions:
- How has this object influenced the behavioral pattern of individuals using it?
- How has this object influenced the behavioral pattern of communities using it?
- Does this object bring people closer together, or push them further apart?
- Who designed this object and why? 
- How prevalent is this object now? If it is a historical object, what made people stop using it?
- What did this object supersede? What superseded this object?

### Assignment 3: Innovation and Invention, Pt. 2 {iandi2}

Based on feedback from class, take a moment to reevaluate your object. How might you best distill the interaction your object hinges upon? Consider both how its form and location influence this interaction, as well as what technologies and inventions influence this designed behavior. If the object requires/maintains multiple types of interactions, how do these produced behaviors work with one another? 

For next class, isolate the object-produced behavior (i.e. interaction) you are most interested in and begin to conceptualize how your object may be translated into a stand-alone website. 

Bring in at least _two_ directions for your site. Focus on clearly illustrating the primariy interaction of your object and how it translates onto the web as well as bringing in several wireframes outlining the structure of your site.
