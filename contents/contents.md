# Core Studio Interaction: Section E

This course exposes students to thorough and elaborate interactive concepts and techniques for applications. It is an extensive investigation in the interface, the mechanism, the controls and the aims of interactive works. Students will learn how to design and develop complex interactive projects and understand how to undertake a comprehensive research and direct their thinking process from brainstorming to final outcome. They will be given the tools to conceive, plan and develop an interactive system and they will become aware of the importance of their role in the development of interactive media.

## Projects {projects}

### Assignment 1: The Post {thepost}

As graphic designers, it is important to understand the internet and its platforms as a medium. What do certain platforms allow for that others do not? How might a platform transform a user's perception of content? Does the design of some platforms feel invisible? What are the implications of posting content on one platform as opposed to another? 

For our first project, find a piece of content that has surpassed its copyright ([archive.org](http://archive.org), [ubu.web](http://ubuweb.com) are good places to start your search). Think about the content's form and message. What qualities stick out to you (is it divided into stanzas? is it repetitive? does it have a linear narrative? was it meant to be rearranged? can it be rearranged? does it have [no letter e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Void)?)? 
Publish your selected text on a platform of your choice. Think about how this act of publishing emphasizes a quality of your content (it does not have to be all at once). How has the content changed through your platform? What is something new that this publishing act has revealed about your content? 

How will the reading of the text be affected by the choice of platform? Does the TUMBLR community create a different context for writing and images than the Second Life community for example? Think also about the technical constraints of different platforms. How are texts broken up? In 140 character blurbs? In longer sequences? How does each piece of text link to the next one. Are there different voices you can use? Can the text be broken up into sequential sections? What about parallel sections? How does the text look on the page? How do all these elements affect your reading of the text? How many of these elements can you control? What is the typical way we read text on the service you are using? Are you interrupting this ‘usual’ read, using it to your advantage?

Document your project through screenshots and think carefully about its presentation. 

### Assignment 2: The Hyperlink, Pt. 1 {hyperlink}

The hyperlink (or link) is arguably the cornerstone of the internet. A hyperlink can transport a user from page to page, or website to website— it acts as the linking mechanism through which the whole internet is at our disposal. Through hyperlinks, a user is able to construct their own path or narrative.

You will design and develop a multi-page website around the hyperlink that intertwines your selected content and produces a new narrative:

Select two pieces of content that complement each other in some way. Think about how these pieces may fragment and weave through each other (how do they relate? Are there points where the content breaks easily? What new meaning can you construct by pairing disparate sentences together? How does seeing fragments of content on each page shift the pacing of your new narrative? Are all the links treated the same? different? What kind of hierarchy can you introduce into your narrative?). 

Begin to think about how the site structure begins to influence the user's understanding of your texts. How might the navigation alter the contents meaning? 

For next class, prepare a short presentation on your selected pieces of content, what you find interesting about their pairing, and how you plan on collaging them, and what new narrative this collaging produces.

### Assignment 2: The Hyperlink, Pt. 2 {hyperlink2}

For next week, make a diagram that maps out your site&rsquo;s structure (i.e. the site&rsquo;s content architecture).

Allow this diagram to be as detailed as possible: what text is on what web page? What pages link to others? Does the narrative loop? how does it intertwine? Are there dead ends? can you go back? Does your site have multiple starting points?

Think about how the structure of your site might influence the user&rsquo;s understanding of your narrative. Is there a traditional beginning, middle, and end? Are they clear to the user? (Should they be clear to the user?)

### Assignment 2: The Hyperlink, Pt. 3 {hyperlink3}

Based on feedback from class, finalize your site&rsquo;s structure. In addition, begin drafting designs (i.e. the user interface) of your site. _For next class, bring in your finalized diagram, and at least two visual directions for your site_. 

Think about how the designs for your interface reflect both the site&rsquo;s content as well as its structure. 
- What visual cues do you provide to your user? 
- How do you signify different types of links?
- How does typography influence the user&rsquo;s understanding of the content?
- Are page designs prescribed? Do they follow a grid? Why/why not?
- What reoccuring visual signals are there? What do they suggest to the user?
